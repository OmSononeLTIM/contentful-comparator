# Contentful Model Comparator

A self-sufficient Node.js tool to compare Contentful content models between spaces. Perfect for syncing models from Pilot to Rollout environments with dependency-aware import ordering.

## Features

- ✅ Export content models directly from Contentful spaces via API
- ✅ Compare specific models between any two spaces (by ID)
- ✅ Field-by-field comparison with detailed reports
- ✅ Detect name mismatches (same ID, different names)
- ✅ Identify missing fields, extra fields, and ID mismatches
- ✅ **Dependency analysis** - detects which models reference others
- ✅ **Smart import ordering** - suggests correct sequence to import models
- ✅ Automated report generation with timestamps
- ✅ Config-driven workflow (no command-line arguments needed)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Setup

1. **Configure your spaces** - Edit `config.json` with your Contentful credentials:

```json
{
  "spaces": {
    "pilot": {
      "spaceId": "your_pilot_space_id",
      "accessToken": "your_pilot_management_token"
    },
    "rollout": {
      "spaceId": "your_rollout_space_id",
      "accessToken": "your_rollout_management_token"
    }
  },
  "modelsToCompare": [
    "productOverview",
    "productVariant",
    "blogPost"
  ]
}
```

2. **Configuration details**:
   - `spaceId`: Your Contentful space ID
   - `accessToken`: Contentful Management API (CMA) token (⚠️ keep private!)
   - `modelsToCompare`: Array of content model IDs (not names) to compare

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
npm start
```

Runs comparison using `config.json` and generates a timestamped report file.

### Custom Config File

```bash
node compare-models.js ./path/to/custom-config.json
```

## Output

### Console Output

The script provides real-time comparison results in the console:

```
🚀 Starting Content Model Comparison
📂 Using config: ./config.json

⏳ Fetching 15 model(s) from Pilot space...
✅ Fetched 15 model(s) from Pilot
⏳ Fetching 15 model(s) from Rollout space...
✅ Fetched 10 model(s) from Rollout

🔍 Comparing 15 model(s)...

============================================================

📋 Comparing: Product Overview
  Pilot ID:   productOverview
  Rollout ID: productOverview
  ✅ IDs match

  📊 Fields:
     Pilot:   48
     Rollout: 46
  ❌ Missing in Rollout: 2
     - Comparison Chart
     - DTC Bundle

❌ Model "Product Variant Block" (ID: productVariantBlock) not found in Rollout space
   ⚠️  This model needs to be imported to Rollout

📋 Comparing: DTC - In the box
  ⚠️  NAME MISMATCH!
  Pilot Name:   "DTC - In the box"
  Rollout Name: "In the box"
  Pilot ID:   inTheBox
  Rollout ID: inTheBox
  ✅ IDs match
```

### Dependency Analysis

When models are missing in Rollout, the script analyzes dependencies and suggests import order:

```
🔗 DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS & SUGGESTED IMPORT ORDER

   Models missing in Rollout: 5

   Dependencies:
   - Product Card (productCard) has no dependencies
   - Video Block (videoBlock) has no dependencies
   - Product Overview (productOverview) depends on: Product Variant (productVariant)
   - Carousel Block (carouselBlock) depends on: Product Card (productCard)
   - Homepage Hero (homepageHero) depends on: Video Block (videoBlock)

   📋 Suggested Import Order (import in this sequence):
   1. Product Card (productCard)
   2. Video Block (videoBlock)
   3. Product Variant (productVariant)
   4. Product Overview (productOverview)
   5. Carousel Block (carouselBlock)
   6. Homepage Hero (homepageHero)

   ℹ️  Import models from top to bottom to handle dependencies correctly.
```

### Summary Report

```
📊 SUMMARY
   Total models compared: 15
   Total issues found: 8
   Perfect matches: 10
   Name mismatches: 1
```

### Report Files

Each run generates a timestamped report file:
- Format: `comparison-report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt`
- Example: `comparison-report_2026-03-24_14-30-15.txt`
- Contains complete comparison details including dependencies

## How It Works

1. **Fetches models** from both spaces using Contentful Management API
2. **Compares field-by-field** - names, IDs, counts, and types
3. **Detects name mismatches** - catches when model names differ but IDs match
4. **Analyzes dependencies** - examines Link and Array fields to find references
5. **Calculates import order** - uses topological sorting to determine correct sequence
6. **Generates reports** - saves detailed comparison to timestamped text file

## Security

⚠️ **Important**: Never commit credentials to version control!

- `config.json` is in `.gitignore` by default
- Keep your Management API tokens private
- Use environment variables for CI/CD pipelines

## Troubleshooting

### Model not found errors
- Ensure you're using model **IDs** (e.g., `productOverview`) not names (e.g., `Product Overview`)
- Check that the model exists in the Pilot space
- Verify your access token has read permissions

### Finding Model IDs
Model IDs are shown in Contentful's web UI:
- Go to Content Model > Click a model
- The ID is in the URL: `...content_types/productOverview/...`
- Or run the script with an invalid ID to see all available IDs

## Current Capabilities

- ✅ Compare content models between two Contentful spaces
- ✅ Identify missing and mismatched fields
- ✅ Detect model name mismatches
- ✅ Analyze dependencies between models
- ✅ Suggest correct import order
- ✅ Generate detailed timestamped reports

## Future Enhancements

- Auto-import missing models from Pilot to Rollout
- Field-level sync capabilities
- Batch operations for multiple config files
- Environment variable support for credentials
- Validation type comparison (required, unique, etc.)
